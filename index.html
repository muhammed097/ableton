                and performance. With
                these products, our community of users creates amazing things.</h2>
            <p>Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our products are used by a
                community of dedicated musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.</p>

            <h2>Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you’re in the flow, it’s
                incredibly rewarding.</h2>
            <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for
                what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

            <h2>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and
                our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</h2>
            <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come
                from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
                and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the
                skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

                magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly
                diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with
                each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

                flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as
                a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
